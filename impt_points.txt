node_modules
    This is a directory where all the actual code for your installed dependencies (like Express, React, etc.) lives.

    When you run npm install, all the packages listed in package.json get downloaded here.

    It can be huge because it includes nested dependencies too.

    ✅ You should not edit anything inside this folder manually.
    ❌ You should not commit it to Git — it’s usually listed in .gitignore.

package.json

    This is the heart of any Node.js project.
    It defines:
        Project name, version
        Scripts (start, dev, etc.)
        Dependencies (express, etc.)
        Dev dependencies (nodemon, eslint, etc.)
    It’s the file you edit manually or generate with npm init.

package-lock.json

    This file locks the exact version of every installed package (and its dependencies).
    It ensures consistent installs across all environments.
    Even if package.json says "express": "^4.18.2", the lock file records the exact version like 4.18.2 and all internal dependencies.
    Generated automatically when you run npm install.
    You should commit this file to Git.

Summary Table

File/Folder	                    Purpose	                                Committed to Git?
node_modules/	        Holds all installed packages	                    ❌ (too big)
package.json	        Describes your project and dependencies	            ✅
package-lock.json	    Locks exact versions for reproducible installs	    ✅

The ^ symbol in a version string in package.json controls how npm updates dependencies when you run npm install.

"express": "^4.18.2"
This means: You want version 4.18.2 or any newer version that doesn’t change the major version.

So it will install anything from:   >= 4.18.2 and < 5.0.0

📦 Version Symbols

Symbol	Meaning
^	Allow updates that do not change the first (major) version number
~	Allow updates that do not change the second (minor) version number
None	Lock to that exact version only
🔢 Version Breakdown
In 4.18.2,
        4 = Major version
        18 = Minor version
        2 = Patch version

Why ^ is Common
It's safe (no breaking changes), but allows you to get bug fixes and minor features.
For libraries like Express, this ensures stability unless a major update (like v5) is released.
